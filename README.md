Starter Repository

Finally made it Github, so here I am looking for what's next.
College grad trying to self-teach myself through some coding in Ruby with Learn Ruby the Hard Way, by Zed Shaw.
Working full-time in the furniture manufacturing industry and I'm ready to start using my brain instead of my back...as my dad suggests.
I listen to podcasts from codenewbie.org, audiobooks like "Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions", and hope
to start a blog on my day by day learning process both as I go and once I'm ready to tackle a bootcamp.

Besides the code, I love some Sudoku puzzles, outdoor/indoor climbing, and drinking some good IPA beer.
Hope I can help start some creative projects here and learn what I can while helping others as I go.
